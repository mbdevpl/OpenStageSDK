	<p>This is the first version of OpenStage SDK, developed in
		September 2011. The OpenStage SDK is a set of Java classes that
		represent XML objects specified in "OpenStage 60/80 - XML
		Applications, Developer's Guide", as of September 2011. Since the
		OpenStage platform is under development, the SDK itself may become
		outdated in the future. Please obtain the latest available SDK before
		you start developing applications.</p>

	<p>This is a Software Development Kit, which aims to speed up the
		process of developing XML applications for OpenStage 60/80 and
		compliant devices. The SDK includes Java representations of all objects
		that are defined in the official documentation. It also provides easy-to-use
		push request constructor and sender.</p>
