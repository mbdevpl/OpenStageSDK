/**
 * This package contains definitions of UI (user interface) objects recognised by OpenStage 
 * VoIP phones. The objects are made according to "OpenStage 60/80 - XML
 * Applications, Developer's Guide" available in September 2011. Features of these devices
 * are currently partially developed, therefore the documentation of the objects will
 * sometimes simply say "in development". Changes are to be expected in the future.
